# AZ Handwritten Alphabets Dataset
This dataset contains images of handwritten alphabets from A to Z in CSV format. It can be valuable for machine learning projects related to image recognition, image classification, and optical character recognition (OCR).
## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of images of handwritten characters in CSV format where each row corresponds to an image of a drawn character. The pixel values of the images are stored directly in the CSV file.
- **Link to Dataset**: [AZ Handwritten Alphabets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)
- **Number of Classes**: 26 (A-Z)
- **Image Format**: Grayscale
- **Resolution**: 28x28 pixels
This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to develop and test algorithms for image recognition tasks and is ideally suited for training deep learning models.
## Installation Instructions
Here are instructions to set up the dataset in your local Python environment for further use in image processing applications:
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```
### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment
Create a Python virtual environment.
```bash
